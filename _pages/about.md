Marie-Félicia Beclin
======

I am a PhD student at [Université de Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/formation) within the [Desbrest Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health](https://idesp.umontpellier.fr/), and I am also a member of the team [PreMeDICaL](https://team.inria.fr/premedical/) at Inria. I am supervised by [Nicolas Molinari](http://n.molinari.free.fr/) and [Pierre Lafaye de Micheaux](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~lafaye/). 

While my foundational education is in engineering, having graduated from Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne, my current focus lies in the realm of applied statistics. Specifically, I am engrossed in the analysis of thoracic computed tomography scans from patients afflicted by asthma
